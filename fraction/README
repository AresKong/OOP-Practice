I) Purpose
Write a class presents a fraction number like 2/3. Functions below have to be implemented for this class:
• default ctor
• ctor takes two integers as parameters
• copy ctor
• arithmetical operators: + - * /
• relational operators: < <= == != >= >
• type cast to double
• toString
• inserter and extractor for streams

II) My method
a) Operator overloaded
Peform +, -, ==, < on fractions by reduction of them to a common denominator
Um, nothing special actually...
b) toString
Using stringstream ss to convert integer into strings. If the numerator of a object is 1
and the denominator is four, then toString return a string “1/4”
c) inserter and extractor for streams
Use free function and declare is as friend of the class Nothing special too...
